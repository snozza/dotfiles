I'll help you with the following task. IMPORTANT: Use puppeteer mcp to take screenshots and visually verify my work:

$ARGUMENTS

My approach:
1. **Initial Visual Capture**: Take a screenshot of the current state before making changes
2. **Progressive Verification**: Capture screenshots after each significant change to ensure visual consistency
3. **Cross-browser Testing**: When applicable, test in different viewport sizes to ensure responsive design
4. **Interactive Elements**: Verify hover states, click interactions, and form submissions visually
5. **Before/After Comparison**: Document visual changes with clear before and after screenshots

Visual verification strategy:
- Capture full page screenshots for layout changes
- Use element-specific screenshots for component modifications
- Test both light and dark themes if applicable
- Verify accessibility features like focus states
- Document any visual regressions or unexpected changes
- Name screenshots descriptively (e.g., "homepage-before-changes", "navbar-after-update")

This visual-first approach ensures that:
- Changes render correctly in the browser
- No unintended visual side effects occur
- The user experience remains consistent
- Visual bugs are caught early in development
